<p><strong>HTML+</strong> engine allows you to specify a Typescript file in your template and it will
                          compile it for you and serve it to the browser.</p>
<code-snippet language="html">

<p>You can add a <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html">tsconfig.json</a> file at the root of your project and setup your editor in order
   to control things and to see errors in the console.</p>
<p>This feature allows you to write future Javascript for the browser and no setup is needed for your projects.</p>
<h3>node-modules script files</h3>
<p>The engine will handle even javascript files imported from some third party module and process them.</p>
<p>When you build your project, these files are also imported, processed and shipped with your site as part of it.</p>
<p>Only make sure that these files are built to run in the browser.</p>
