<p>Partials are simply a way to split your templates into parts that can be reused in different templates.</p>
<h3>Create Partials</h3>
<p>To create a partial files all you have to do is create an HTML file which the name starts with an underscore.</p>
<code-snippet>
# File Structure               # Routes

- server.js
- pages
	- index.html                 /
	- contact.html               /contact
	- about.html                 /about
	- 404.html                   /404
	- partials
		- _header.html
	- projects
		- index.html               /projects
		- todo-project.html        /projects/todo-project
</code-snippet>
<p>Partial files are ignored by the routes and can only be included in a page templates.</p>
<h3>Include partials</h3>
<p>To include a partial in your page template you must use the <a href="/documentation/api-reference/include-tag">include tag</a>.</p>
<code-snippet language="html">
<!-- _header.html  -->
<header>
	<h1>Projects</h1>
	<p class="description">Welcome to the projects page</p>
</header>
</code-snippet>
<p>The include tag takes the name of the partial file (without underscore and extension)
   as the value of the <strong>partial attribute</strong> and will include the partial file content in your template.</p>
<code-snippet language="html">
<!-- project.html  -->
<include partial="header"></include>
</code-snippet>
<p>This means that <strong>partial file names must be unique</strong> and they can be placed anywhere inside
   your pages directory.</p>
<p>You can also use the <strong>partial-path attribute</strong> to include another template or partial file.</p>
<code-snippet language="html">
<!-- project.html  -->
<include partial="header"></include>
<include partial-path="../content.html"></include>
</code-snippet>
<p>When using the <strong>partial-path attribute</strong> the file you include does not have to be a partial file
   which means the file name may not need to start with an underscore.</p>
<h3>Partials data and context</h3>
<p>Our header partial file example above has hardcoded title and description which does not make it reusable.</p>
<p>We can use <a href="/documentation/template-data-binding">template binding</a> to expect a value for the title and description so it can be set
   to match the pages it is included at.</p>
<code-snippet language="html">
<!-- _header.html  -->
<header>
	<h1>{title}</h1>
	<p class="description">{description}</p>
</header>
</code-snippet>
<p>By default partial files inherit the context of the template file they are include in.</p>
<p>By declaring the title and description in our project template it will automatically be inherited
   by the partial included after the declaration.</p>
<code-snippet language="html">
<!-- project.html  -->
<variable name="title">Projects</variable>
<variable name="description">Welcome to the projects page</variable>

<include partial="header"></include>
</code-snippet>
<p>Creating variable solely to be inherited by the partial may not be a good option because it is not
   obvious that the declaration is needed by the partial.</p>
<p>To make it more explicit, the <a href="/documentation/api-reference/include-tag">include tag</a> takes context data for the partial as data attribute
   value which the value must be a Javascript object literal.</p>
<code-snippet language="html">
<!-- project.html  -->
<include partial="header"
         data="{
            title: 'Projects',
            description: 'Welcome to the projects page'
         }"></include>
</code-snippet>
