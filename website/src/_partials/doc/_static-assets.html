<p>Any assets you link in your HTML pages, CSS and Javascript files must exist inside the pages directory.</p>
<p>The engine will resolve relative paths in the best of it abilities even when you want to build your
site for production.</p>
<h3>HTML assets</h3>
<p>Relative path to assets are resolve even when you link them from partial files. All paths end up being resolved in relation
to the page template file the partial was included at.</p>
<code-snippet language="html">
<img src="../assets/logo.png" alt="log">
</code-snippet>
<h3>CSS assets</h3>
<p>Relative path of assets in CSS are also resolved even if you import different files. They are all resolved to be
inside the pages directory in relation to the page the css file is linked to.</p>
<code-snippet language="css">
#banner {
	background: url(..bg.jpeg);
}
</code-snippet>
<h3>Javascript/Typescript assets</h3>
<p>Import of assets inside javascript or typescript files are also resolved but what you get may vary from the
   actual text or content of the file. Almost all assets import will return simply the name of the file.</p>
<code-snippet language="js">
import logo from "../assets/logo.png";
