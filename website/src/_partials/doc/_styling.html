<p>When you build your website you want it to look good and therefore, style it!</p>
<p>Setting up the environment can come with some pain and may require learning about many different tooling
and setup procedures.</p>
<p>What <strong>HTML+</strong> does for you is set everything up for you so you can just start writing CSS using
modern Syntax and preprocessors like <a href="https://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a>,
	<a href="https://lesscss.org/">LESS</a> and <a href="https://stylus-lang.com/">STYLUS</a>.</p>
<p>All this is so you can get to coding sooner while your website benefits from modern CSS that works on most browsers.</p>
<h3>node-modules style files</h3>
<p>The engine will handle even CSS files imported from some third party module and process them. This means that
sass, less, stylus files are all imported and processed as if they are part of the project.</p>
<p>When you build your project, these files are also imported, processed and shipped with your site</p>
