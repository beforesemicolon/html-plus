<p>If you reuse a template to change is content based on the data you pass for different routes, you will need to
change those into static pages on build as well. This is if you decide not to go with a live server.</p>
<p>It may look something like this:</p>
<code-snippet language="js">
const {engine} = require('@beforesemicolon/html-plus');

const app = express();

engine(app, path.resolve(__dirname, './pages'));

app.get('/documentation/:doc?', (req, res) => {
	res.render('documentation', {doc: req.params.doc})
});
</code-snippet>
<p>Here we are reusing the <strong>documentation</strong> template for different url parameter for <strong>doc</strong>.
This is so we can change how the documentation page looks accordingly and since it is not based on a file structure,
the builder will not know about it since it only look for files in your pages directory.</p>
<h3>Templates option</h3>
<p>The <strong>templates</strong> options allow you to specify as many dynamic templates you want with their respective
data list and place to be to be compiled.</p>
<code-snippet language="js">
const {build} = require("@beforesemicolon/html-plus");
const path = require("path");

build({
	srcDir: path.resolve(__dirname, './pages'),
	destDir: path.resolve(__dirname, '../public'),
	templates: [
		{
			path: path.resolve(__dirname, './pages/documentation.html'),
			dataList: [
				['/documentation/getting-started', {doc: 'getting-started'}],
				['/documentation/faq', {doc: 'faq'}],
				['/documentation/api-reference', {doc: 'api-reference'}],
			]
		}
	]
}).then(() => {
	console.log('done');
})
</code-snippet>
<p>Above we are doing the same thing we did in the dynamic routes. The difference here is that we are specifying
all the <strong>doc</strong> params and the path where the file would be if it was not dynamic</p>
<p>The building will use the template specified in <strong>path</strong> and for each data item
will create a file with the first value of the list tuple and passe the second value as context data.</p>

<content-navigation currentPage="currentPage"></content-navigation>
