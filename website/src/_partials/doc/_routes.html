<p><strong>HTML+ engine</strong> by default will use your pages directory files structure to create your site routes.</p>
<p>This means that all you have to do is organize your <a href="/documentation/routes/pages">HTML page</a> files
   in a manner it reflects the routes you want by grouping and nesting HTML files as you like.</p>
<code-snippet>
# File Structure               # Routes

- server.js
- pages
   - index.html                /
   - contact.html              /contact
   - about.html                /about
   - 404.html                  /404
   - projects
      - index.html             /projects
      - todo-project.html      /projects/todo-project
</code-snippet>
<p>The name of the file is very important and <em>index.html</em> files will always resolve to <b>/</b> path or
the directory name as you can see for projects path above.</p>
