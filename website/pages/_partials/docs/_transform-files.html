<p>The <a href="">Transform API</a> is how all files are processed internally and this API is exposed to you so you
can build things on top of it for more control.</p>
<code-snippet language="js">
const {transform} = require('@beforesemicolon/html-plus');
</code-snippet>
<p>This object expose a few methods which are language specific.</p>

<code-snippet language="js">
const {transform} = require('@beforesemicolon/html-plus');

// synchronous method
transform.html('<h2>Some markup</h2>');

// asynchronous methods
await transform.sass('$margin: 0; p {margin: $margin;}');
await transform.less('@margin: 0; p {margin: @margin;}');
await transform.stylus(`
$margin = 0
p
  margin: $margin
`);
await transform.js('const fn = x => x + 10;');
await transform.css('p {margin: 0;}');
</code-snippet>
<h3>Options</h3>
<p>Options vary for each but so please refer to the <a href="">Transform API reference</a> for more details
   on supporting options for each.</p>
<p>One option they all have in common is the <a href="">file</a> option which is a way <strong>HTML+</strong>
   is trying to make it easy to work with files in general.</p>
<code-snippet language="js">
const {transform, File} = require('@beforesemicolon/html-plus');
const path = require('path');

const file = new File(path.resolve(__dirname, 'app.sass'));

await transform.sass({file});
</code-snippet>
<p>The <a href="">File</a> class is a powerful way to load files and create them and it is used internally for everything
as it does the heavy lifting. Refer to its API reference for more details.</p>
