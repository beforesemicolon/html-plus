<p>You may want to reuse the same page template for different routes. For example,
   all document pages you read under the /documentation path of this website uses the same template
   but displays different content depending on the routes and data passed to it.</p>
<p>Because each HTML file can only correspond to a single route path, you need to setup
   a dynamic express route to serve the template you want.</p>
<code-snippet language="js">
const {engine} = require('@beforesemicolon/html-plus');

const app = express();

engine(app, path.resolve(__dirname, './pages'));

app.get('/documentation/:doc?', (req, res) => {
	res.render('documentation', {some: "data"})
});
</code-snippet>
<p>When you call the <em>render</em> method in the express response object, you don't need the initial
   forward-slash or to indicate the file extension. Every name of file you specify is know to be under the
   pages directory path you provided.</p>
<p>This is also a nice way to pass specific data per route as you will learn more about
   when you explore <a href="/documentation/data">how data works with templates.</a></p>
<h3>Deep nested template files</h3>
<p>You can refer to deeply nested templates using the forward-slash to indicate nested template file.</p>
<code-snippet language="js">
app.get('/projects/:projectName', (req, res) => {
	res.render(`projects/project`)
});
</code-snippet>
<include partial="documentation-menu" data="{currentPage}"></include>
