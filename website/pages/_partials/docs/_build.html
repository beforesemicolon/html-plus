<p><strong>HTML+</strong> comes with a static site builder for when you are ready to take your site life to production.</p>
<p>With a simple API, most of the work is done under the hood to ensure your website will work
as you intend it to and these are things like:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Only include referenced files from your pages, style and script files;</li>
	<li>Minify and purge both CSS and Javascript;</li>
	<li>Organize your site structure and resolve relative paths;</li>
	<li>Create production quality CSS that can work in as many browsers as possible;</li>
	<li>Compile all Typescript and CSS preprocessors to files that work for the browser;</li>
	<li>Hash all connected resources to your pages to bypass browser caching;</li>
</ul>
<p>The builder has only couple of options which share a lot with the engine options already and it is more
like an alternative options for a live handling the engine does.</p>
<p>This builder is not yet compatible with other popular site builders but its small size and simple API
may be just what you need for your project.</p>
