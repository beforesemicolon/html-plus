<p>When you build your website you want it to look good and therefore, style it!</p>
<p>Setting up the environment can come with some pain and may require learning about many different tooling
and setup procedures.</p>
<p>What <strong>HTML+</strong> does for you is set everything up for you so you can just start writing CSS using
modern Syntax and preprocessors like <a href="https://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a>,
	<a href="https://lesscss.org/">LESS</a> and <a href="https://stylus-lang.com/">STYLUS</a>.</p>
<p>For more advanced users, it allows you to extend these setups with plugins or presets easily.</p>
<p>All this is so you can get to coding sooner while your website benefits from modern CSS that works on most browsers.</p>
