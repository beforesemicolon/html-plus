<p>To create pages you must first specify in which directory relative to the server you will be placing
   your HTML pages.</p>
<code-snippet language="js">
const {engine} = require('@beforesemicolon/html-plus');

const app = express();

engine(app, path.resolve(__dirname, './pages'));
</code-snippet>
<p>Once you have your pages directory, which you can name anything you want, you can start creating
   HTML files which will be used as pages.</p>
<p>As mentioned in <a href="/documentation/routes">routes</a>, the way you structure your pages directory files
   is how you want your routes. <strong>There are a few things you should know when doing so:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>index.html</strong> corresponds to <em>"/"</em> path or the path of the directory
        it is placed inside. So placing <em>index.html</em> at the root pages directory will match path "/" and
        placing in, for example, projects directory will match <em>"/projects"</em> path.</li>
	<li>Any html file name that starts with <em>"underscore"</em> will be seen as a partial file. No path will match such files.
	    Use this rule to <a href="/documentation/templating/partials-and-include">create partials</a> that you can include in your page files.</li>
	<li>By default, <em>"/404"</em> will have a default page. You can override this by simply creating
	    a <em>404.html</em> file at the root pages directory.</li>
	<li>Any html file inside the pages directory will be used instead of
		<a href="/documentation/routes/express-routes">express custom routes</a> your create.</li>
	<li>Every file will match a single route and any html page can be used as template for different routes
	    if you setup the page in your <a href="/documentation/routes/express-routes">express custom route</a> you create.</li>
</ul>
