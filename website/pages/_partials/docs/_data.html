<p><strong>HTML+</strong> templates can be made fully aware of your data files and injecting or creating
	context data is super easy to do either inside the template itself or the initial configuration.</p>
<p>Another spetacular aspect of the data is that it can be contextualized and there is no need to
   keep passing data to partial files when you include them.</p>
<p>Data can be provided or created in few ways:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="documentation/data/static-data"><strong>Through initial engine configuration</strong></a>:
		This is great for when you want to fetch data from database when server starts and make it available inside templates.</li>
	<li><a href="documentation/data/dynamic-data"><strong>On every page request</strong></a>: This is particular great
		when you want to inject data specific to that template or something from the request made like form data or uploaded
		file details.</li>
	<li><a href="documentation/data/context-data"><strong>On includes and with local scoped variables</strong></a>: This
		is great when you wan for a specific part of the template to have a unique sample of the data and even
		override to global data provided.</li>
</ul>
<p>With <strong>HTML+</strong> templates, data can be global and scoped(context) which allows for unique templates
   to be build to fit the exact need you have.</p>
<p>The templates are built in a way to enforce data imutability. This is so when you override data in one
   template will never affect how data is in another.</p>
