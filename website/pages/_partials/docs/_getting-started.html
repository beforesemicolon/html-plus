<p>With <strong>HTML+</strong> you can write smaller and more powerful HTML using it as template language
   and with the power of the <a href="/documentation/api-reference/engine-function">engine</a>, it can manage all pages and resources connected to the
   pages like CSS, SASS, LESS, Stylus and Typescript so you can write the most modern code you can.</p>
<p>When you are <a href="/documentation/build"><em>ready to deploy</em></a>, it comes with a static site builder to build your project for production
   or you can simply continue to use it in a live server for a dynamic website with all batteries included and no extra setup.</p>
<h3>Requirements</h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node</a> 10 or later</li>
	<li><a href="https://expressjs.com/">Express</a> 4 or later</li>
</ul>
<h3>Create Your Project</h3>
<p>You may use any tool or strategy that you know to create a node project. You may also use the terminal or command
line to run the following commands to set it up.</p>
<code-snippet>
#create directory named "my-app"
mkdir my-app

#navigate inside the created directory
cd my-app

#initialize npm and follow the prompt
npm init
</code-snippet>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>Inside your newly created project you can proceed to install <strong>HTML+</strong> and express:</p>
<code-snippet>
npm install express
npm install @beforesemicolon/html-plus
</code-snippet>
<h3>Server Setup</h3>
<p>Create your server file and a pages directory(can be named anything you want).</p>
<code-snippet>
mkdir pages
touch server.js
</code-snippet>
<p>Your project file structure should look like so:</p>
<code-snippet>
my-app
  - pages
  - server.js
  - package.json
  - package-lock.json
</code-snippet>
<p>Inside your <em>server.js</em> file the simplest setup you can have is importing
	<a href="/documentation/api-reference/engine-function">HTML+ engine</a>, create your express app to pass it to
   the engine along with the path to the directory where you will put the html page files.</p>
<code-snippet language="js">
// server.js
const express = require('express');
const http = require('http');
const path = require('path');
const {engine} = require('@beforesemicolon/html-plus');

const app = express();

engine(app, path.resolve(__dirname, './pages'));

const server = http.createServer(app);

server.listen(3000)
</code-snippet>
<p><strong>HTML+ engine</strong> will setup your <a href="/documentation/routes">Routes</a> for your pages
 and all handlers for CSS(including preprocessors), Javascript and Typescript files.</p>
