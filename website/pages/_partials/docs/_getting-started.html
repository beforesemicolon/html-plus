<p>With <strong>HTML+</strong> you can write smaller and more powerful HTML using it as template language
   and with the power of the engine, it can manage all pages and resources connected to the pages like CSS and
   Typescript so you can write the most modern code you can.</p>
<p>When you are <em>ready to deploy</em>, it comes with a static site builder to build your project for production
   or you can simply continue to use live for a dynamic website with all batteries included.</p>
<h3>Requirements</h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node</a> 10 or later</li>
	<li>Any OS that NodeJs can run</li>
	<li><a href="https://expressjs.com/">Express</a> 4 or later</li>
</ul>
<h3>Create Your Project</h3>
<p>You can create your node project how you normally do by using some tool or executing the following commands:</p>
<code-snippet>
	mkdir my-app
	cd my-app
	npm init
</code-snippet>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>Inside your project you can proceed to install <strong>HTML+</strong> and express:</p>
<code-snippet>
	npm install express
	npm install @beforesemicolon/html-plus
</code-snippet>
<h3>Server Setup</h3>
<p>The simplest setup you can have is importing <strong>HTML+</strong>, create your express app to pass it to
   the engine along with the directory where you will put the html page files.</p>
<p><strong>HTML+ engine</strong> will setup your <a href="/documentation/routing">Routes</a> and all handlers for
                                 CSS(including preprocessors), Javascript and Typescript.</p>
