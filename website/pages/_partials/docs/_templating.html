<p>The whole point of a template language is to simplify things and for <strong>HTML+</strong> it is all about
   writing less and making it as reusable as possible.</p>
<p>There are many ways to make templates small and reusable and <strong>HTML+</strong> has few new and common
   features to do just that.</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href=""><strong>Partials</strong></a> allow you to split your templates into small reusable parts and
        to be included in different templates.</li>
	<li><a href=""><strong>Template Injection</strong></a> allows you to inject markup inside partials so they
           can be dynamic and look different case by case while still reusable.</li>
	<li><a href=""><strong>Conditional render</strong></a> is important in defining what parts of the template
         should be sent to the browser depending on some logic in the template.</li>
	<li><a href=""><strong>Repetition</strong></a> makes your template smaller and capable of handling long list
        of data that would be tedious to type so you can only focus on the data that causes the repetition in the template.</li>
	<li><a href=""><strong>Variables</strong></a> are a powerful way to create local data, define reusable
        data as well as compacting logic that may crowd the template tags.</li>
	<li><a href=""><strong>Fragments</strong></a> are the simplest way to group tags either for repetition or logic
        without having to wrap them in a HTML tag.</li>
	<li><a href=""><strong>Customization</strong></a> is the most powerful aspect of templating. <strong>HTML+</strong>
      allows you to create your own <a href="">attributes</a> and <a href="">tags</a> to take care of complex logic and
	  calculation you can't do inside the templates.</li>
	<li><a href=""><strong>Debugging</strong></a> when you have powerful templates it only makes sense to
        be able to debug it efficiently. <strong>HTML+</strong> helps you with that with specific error messages
        and a way to <a href="">log</a> your template logic or data.</li>
</ul>
<p>All these features make <strong>HTML+</strong> a unique template language to write powerful HTML pages.
   The best feature of all is that it is all HTML, no additional markup to create your templates. It should
   feel super familiar.</p>
