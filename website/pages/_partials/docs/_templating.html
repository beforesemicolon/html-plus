<p>The whole point of a template language is to simplify things and for <strong>HTML+</strong> it is all about
   writing less and making it reusable.</p>
<p>There are many ways to make templates small and reusable and <strong>HTML+</strong> has few new and common
   features to do just that.</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href=""><strong>Partials</strong></a> allow you to split your template into small reusable parts and
	                                             include them in different templates.</li>
	<li><a href=""><strong>Template Injection</strong></a> allows you to inject markup inside partials so they
	                                                       can be dynamic and look different case by case while stil reusable.</li>
	<li><a href=""><strong>Condional render</strong></a> is important in defining what parts of the template
	                                                     should be sent to the browser depending on some logic in the template.</li>
	<li><a href=""><strong>Repetion</strong></a> makes your template smaller and capable of hanlding long list
	                                             of data that would be tedious to type and only focus on the data that causes the repetion in the template.</li>
	<li><a href=""><strong>Variables</strong></a> are a powerful way to create local data, define reusable
	                                              data as well as compacting logic that may croud the template tags.</li>
	<li><a href=""><strong>Framents</strong></a> are the simplest way to group tags either for repetion or logic
	                                             without having to wrap them in a HTML tag.</li>
	<li><a href=""><strong>Customization</strong></a> is the most powerful aspect of templating. <strong>HTML+</strong>
	                                                  allows you to create your own attributes and tags to take care of complex logic and calculation you can't
	                                                  do inside the templates</li>
	<li><a href=""><strong>Debugging</strong></a> when you have powerful templates it only makes sense to
	                                              be able to debug it efficiently and <strong>HTML+</strong> helps you with that with specific error messages
	                                              and a way to log you template logic.</li>
</ul>
<p>All these features make <strong>HTML+</strong> a unique template language to write powerful pages.
   The best feature of all is that it is all HTML, no additional markup to create your templates. It should
   feel super familiar.</p>
